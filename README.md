# ðŸš€ CJ Vibe Launch

Welcome to **CJ Vibe Launch** â€” my web dev playground where I try new layouts, colors, and microâ€‘animations. This is where I test bold ideas, polish small interactions, and just let my creative coding side loose!

## âœ¨ Highlights
- Minimalist landing page with clean structure
- Interactive elements with hover effects
- Ready to grow: designed for future JavaScript or media embeds

## ðŸŒ± Why I Built This
I wanted a flexible sandbox to experiment with design trends, play with CSS, and push boundaries as I level up my web skills.

## ðŸ”­ Next Steps
- Add a hero image or video background
- Try a scroll animation or typing effect
- Build out a multiâ€‘section layout
